## Ant Colony Optimization Visualization

- GitHub: [Link](https://github.com/mahakmandlecha19/AntColonyOptimization)
- Web Based Visualization: [Link](https://mahakmandlecha19.github.io/AntColonyOptimization/#/visualisation)

The above link can be used to visualize working of ant colony optimization by specifying parameters like no. of cities, evaporation rate, Q, alpha, beta, no. of ants
and no. of iterations.

## Ant Colony Optimization Demonstration

Steps to import Ant Colony Optimization project in IDE:-
1. Clone the above repository of Ant Colony Optimization Demonstration using github command.
2. Import the files in an IDE(preferred is netbeans IDE 12.04 and java version higher than 8).  

Note:- It will contain three java files as follows:-
 - ACO.java - which contain main function
 - ACOImplement.java - which contains the implementation of ACO algorithm like initializing pheromone , allocating next vm to a task updating local pheromone then global pheromone.
 - DataCenterBroker.java - which is the same as in the cloudsim with some changes in it.
3. Add cloudsim jar file under the library section of the project directory.
4. Then run the ACO.java file to get the output of Ant Colony Optimization.
